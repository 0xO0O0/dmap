This is the state of the dmap repo shortly after deployment.
Here is the dmap address: 0x90949c9937A11BA943C7A72C3FA073a37E3FdD96

We are keeping this repo here for reference but development is now
fragmented across many repos. There is no 'official' dmap project repo,
dmap is defined by one simple object that treats every caller identically.
